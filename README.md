## Description:
	A chat bot that responds to you with memes based on a user’s text input and mood.
	Also does helpful little tasks
	TLDR: Alexa with memes

## Instructions:
	Type some garbage and look at memes.
	Type certain keywords to activate features

## Features:
### Must Haves:
Pull meme GIFs using Tenor API based on category


Gets and analyses large data set


Display gif/image on screen (PApplet)


Analyzes text input from user and replies with relevant photo/meme/gif


Plays music based on user request


School appropriate demo mode


### Want-To-Haves:

Speech to text with mic instead of typing (for the pi) (STATUS AS OF MAY 24TH: IS BEING DEBUGGED)


Sentiment analysis (STATUS AS OF MAY 24TH: WORKING)


Rate memes (help the bot improve future results through user input) (STATUS AS OF MAY 24TH: NOPE)


Different modes: SAFE mode for only memes that are work/school ok - no swearing, etc; NSFW mode for unfiltered, all memes (STATUS AS OF MAY 24TH: WORKING)


Maybe also finds music relevant to the sentiment analysis results


### Stretch features:
Pi screen on gimbal that always points towards the victim 


Face tracking


Audio triggered like Alexa
