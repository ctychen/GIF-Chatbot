_Final Project for Mr. Shelby’s 5th period, 2018-2019 class._

### Hardware concept:
![idea](https://i.imgur.com/z820oNc.png)

## Description:
	A chat bot that responds to you with memes based on a user’s text input and mood.
	Also does helpful little tasks
	TLDR: Alexa with memes

## Instructions:
	Type some garbage and look at memes.
	Type certain keywords to activate features

## Features:
### Must Haves:
* Web Fetcher/Scraper or other tool to pull memes from websites based on category
* Get and analyse large data set
* Display gif/image on screen
* Analyzes text input from user and replies with relevant photo/meme/gif
* Does something useful: opens programs, plays music, etc are sample ideas: “Play me some music”; It would be fun if it could tell you about the weather forecast if you ask it (Yahoo Weather API, “What’s the weather like at ...?”)
* School appropriate demo mode (doesn’t pull memes off all of Reddit)


## Want-To-Haves:
* Speech to text with mic instead of typing (for the pi)
* Sentiment analysis
* Rate memes (help the bot improve future results through user input)
* Different modes: SAFE mode for only memes that are work/school ok - no swearing, etc; NSFW mode for unfiltered, all memes
* Plays music - Maybe have a keyword for that, if user types keyword + song, then it takes the substring after the keyword and searches for that on YouTube, then gives you top search result. [This discord bot for inspiration...](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot). Maybe also finds music relevant to the sentiment analysis results

## Stretch features:
* Pi screen on gimbal that always points towards the victim 
* Face tracking
* Audio triggered like Alexa 
* auTo gEnERAted muSIc 
* aUTo GEneRATed CLEAN meMEs (See also: Subreddit Simulator, https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04510)
* Multiple personalities
